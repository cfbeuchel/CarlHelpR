CarlHelpR 0.0.36 (Release date: March 05th, 2018)
=========

Changes in this version:
~~~~~~~~~
* add color_dens_area function
* small changes to theme_carl

Changes in the last version:
~~~~~~~~~
* add data.table to namespace and @import in change_in_dt function to avoid errors.
 Â° Apparently this is not best practice, but cannot be avoided due to the inability to use data.table::`:=` and data.table::.SD
